# Currency-Cop-Companion
Chrome extension for easy retrieval of the Path of Exile POESESSID value for use with Currency Cop.

A tiny extension which allows the user to instantly access their 'POESESSID' for use with Currency
Cop, so that they don't have to dig through cookies in developer tools. Good for non-technically 
inclined people who just want to login into CC.

Here is the page within the Chrome Web Store:
